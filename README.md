<center><h3>A mod that adds Soul Magic and Soul Owning into Minecraft.</h3></center>

## Features

### Magic Systems:
- Soul Magic, represented by the Soul Sand Valley and the color cyan. It uses contracts as the main method of manipulation.
- Dominic Magic, represented by a desaturated golden color. It uses Dominic items as the main method of manipulation.

### The Magic Orbs:
- To craft most items, you'll need Soul Orbs or Dominic Orbs, depending on the magic type you want to use.
- Soul Orbs are obtained by killing a player on soul sand, which can also include yourself.
- Dominic Orbs cannot be obtained in survival mode to prevent chaos, though there is a config option that makes them obtainable from withers.

### Signeable Items:
- The Contract is the most important item in the mod. It is used with most of the devices the mod adds.
- The Soulbound Contract is a variation of the normal contract. It holds significantly more power over the signer. You can find more about this by enabling Advanced Tooltips (F3 + H).
- The Wandering Tablet is a special kind of signable item. It can only be used on a Waystone as a more restrictive TPA-like system.

### The Waystone:
- The Waystone is a teleportation device that requires a Contract or a Wandering Tablet, along with XP, to function.
- Right-click it with a Contract and it will cost you XP to use. The Contract will be consumed, and the signer will be teleported on top of the Waystone.
- Right-click it with a Wandering Tablet and it will cost the bound player XP to use. The bound player must also be sneaking when it is activated. The Tablet will not be consumed, and the bound player will be teleported on top of the Waystone.

### The Idol:
- The Idol protects the player who placed it from direct attacks by others bound to them through contracts.

### Dominic Weapons:
- Their main function is that they can get rid of players permanently, through different methods.
- The weapons don't actually ban the players; they only put them in spectator mode.

## Misc

### The Soul Candle:
- A block that prevents mobs from spawning in a 64-block radius. _(Configurable)_

### Soul Glass:
- A glass variant that can be turned on and off, and that triggers a chain reaction that turns on and off any neighboring Soul Glass blocks.

### Ghosts:
- You can use "/dominium:ghost <add; clear; list; remove>" to add a player as a ghost.
- Ghosts are invisible beings with increased stealth that can only be seen in the corner of the screen. 
- If you're a ghost, you can hold a Dominic Effigy in your main hand or offhand to become completely visible or invisible.

### The Item Marker:
- You can use "/dominium:marker <clear; get; set>" while holding an Item Marker to set its text. (Example: "/dominium:marker set Given by CalinXD")
- When holding this item in your main hand, and most Dominic weapons or items in your offhand, you can add the text from the Item Marker as lore to the Dominic weapon or item.

### Spectator+:
- When you're in spectator mode, you can now interact with some blocks such as doors, trapdoors, buttons, bells, and more!
