# Why I’ve currently privated the mod on Modrinth
- I want to clarify the situation and take responsibility. I knowingly used artwork that wasn’t mine and tried to modify it by changing colors, believing that would make it acceptable. I now understand this was wrong. Recoloring or minor edits do not make someone else’s work mine.
- That decision was my mistake. Even though I was focused on development at the time, I should have either created my own assets or asked for permission. I rushed the release after showing the mod to friends and getting excited feedback, which led me to prioritize speed over proper handling.
- To prevent further issues, I’ve privated the mod. I will remove or replace all problematic artwork with original or properly authorized assets before making anything public again.
- I apologize to the original artist(s) and to the community. I’m taking this seriously and will handle assets correctly going forward.
- I’ll also take the time to rework and review the entire mod. Once I’m confident that everything is in order and ready for release, I’ll make it public again.
